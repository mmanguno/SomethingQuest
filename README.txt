SYNOPSIS                                                
--------------------------------------------------------
    SomethingQuest is a very simple, very sparse,       
text-based Role Playing Game.  It contains a small      
plot and a "battle arena" where the user may "fight"    
against randomly-selected enemies.  Really, it's less   
of a full game, and  more of an experiment. The         
programming within makes a skeleton.  Just add          
some more text and decisions to the plot(), and         
you've got yourself a full game.

NOTES                                                   
--------------------------------------------------------
*This program is best run in some terminal emulator,    
or at least some program that does not raise a pop-up   
whenever an "input( )" call is made.                    
                                                        
*Whenever the user is prompted, make sure that you do   
not enter another number after the one you have chosen: 
in some environments, this provides the next prompt with
the mistakenly chosen number.

        1. Changed around the wording of the README.    
        2. Added the screen-clearing commands to the    
           'quit' option on the main menu.              
        3. Changed the name of 'credits' on the main    
           menu to 'about'.                             
        4. Added the version number to the 'about'      
           option on the main menu                      
        5. Edited some comments within the code.
