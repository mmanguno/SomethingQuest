*This program is best run in some terminal emulator,
or at least some program that does not raise a pop-up
whenever an "input( )" call is made.

*Whenever the user is prompted, make sure that you do 
not enter another number after the one you have chosen:
in some environments, this provides the next prompt with
the mistakenly chosen number.
