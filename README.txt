SYNOPSIS
-----------------------------------------------------
    SomethingQuest is a very simple, very sparse,   
text-based Role Playing Game.  It contains a small  
plot and a "battle arena" where the user may "fight"
against randomly-selected enemies.  Really, it's less
of a full game more of an experiment. The programming
within makes a skeleton.  Just add some more text and
decisions to the plot(), and you've got yourself a  
full game.

NOTES
--------------------------------------------------------
*This program is best run in some terminal emulator,   
or at least some program that does not raise a pop-up  
whenever an "input( )" call is made.                   
                                                       
*Whenever the user is prompted, make sure that you do  
not enter another number after the one you have chosen:
in some environments, this provides the next prompt with
the mistakenly chosen number.
